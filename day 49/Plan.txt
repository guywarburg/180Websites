Day 49 - Weather Report

Plan start - 10:15

Mission:
Build a simple app that provides the temperature of any location via API.
Small form + out display. The background color is defined by the temperature.

HTML:
Basic inline form.
div to display the results with two inner text placeholders

CSS:
fix form styling.
Style the response div - large circle with wide border.
Animation toTop - moves the form to the top of the page.

JS:
form on submit - call API and display results.
color converter.

plan:
1. layout
2. css animation
3. study api
4. build api into code.
5. color converter.

start coding - 10:20

Finished layout and animation - 10:55
Tried to use css animation - worked fine but jumped back to original location. Decided to use js instead.
11:30 - took a break, resumed 13:40
14:45 - Finished website!

Api was easier than I thought.
Regarding the random color converter, I didnâ€™t really want it random, I wanted it to convey the temperature. I simply made a long if statement for several different colors. In order to keep a good looking scheme I kept the same luminosity and saturation - cool tip I learned while making another website :).

Total coding: 2 hours.
