Day 55 - Paratroopers

Plan - 12:15

Build a paratrooper game. An airplane flies across the ‘sky’ and user triggers paratroopers to jump. The paratroopers must land on the island in order to survive.
Each round has a different goal (amount of paratroopers that must land successfully), different island size and location.

Html - One big canvas.
Css - locate canvas

JS:

Object -
* plane (location, speed, move(), getLocation(), set/getSpeed()) + draw
* paratrooper (location, move(), getLocation()) + draw
* Island (location, getLocation()) + draw

Loop -
Plane move
draw plane
move all paratroopers
if paratrooper-y-locaiton > someValue
    if compare location( paratrooper island) {
        score+1
    else
        lives-1
draw island
draw paratroopers

Issue - add ‘physics’ - curve the fall of the paratroopers.

tasks:
1. html + css - layout
2. js - plane ongoing.
3. add island with tree
4. add paratrooper - straight drop
5. add 3 levels - including score display, game-over, and match paratrooper landed in island (see if restart is complex, if not implement as well)
6. add - ‘physics’ - idea, get speed from plane as dx value, on move y+=dy, x+=dx, dx *= 0.8 (or any value that slowly decreases).
7. add more rounds and restart (remember to unbind event listener)

Start - 13:55
1. (Already completed) - html+css - no game over modal. > next > js plane
2. JS Plane - 13:25 - works as closure with all necessary methods. > next > add island with tree
3. JS island - 13:50 - works. > next > paratrooper
4. took a break, 14:15 - 14:40 complete with ‘physics’. > next > test if landed in island. [Didn’t start - took break]
5. resumed coding at 22:05 - 22:30 - function can tell when paratrooper landed or died. > next > create lives and score and create update functions. BREAK
6. resumed - 22:40 - 23:15 - game complete!!

For tomorrow - need to start exercising how to remove event listeners.
