Day 50 - Color Wars (Cellular Automata)

Today’s websites deals with Cellular Automata. A new concept I just read about.
Jenifer implements it with colors, I would like to start with the classic ‘game of life’ and see if I have time to proceed to changing it to color.

Html:
div wrapper and a canvas within.

Css:
center wrapper
set bg color
vertically move a bit the canvas.

JS:
create an infinite loop that calls the nextGen function.
nextGen build a canvasImageData according to the rules and draws it once ready.

- functions:
    - init => draws random state. (called once)
    - loop => for each generation - calls nextGen, puts returned ImageData, timeout and again.
    - nextGen => creates a iterates each pixel in the current ImageData and creates a new image applying the rules, returning the new ImageData. (called each generation)
    -rules => returns value of square according to given params. (run per pixel per gen).
    - 
    
plan:
1. layout
2. build random basic grid.
3. build rule and run once.
4. add loop.

Coding:
18:05 - completed basic layout.
// Didn’t update…
20:40 - finished functional Cellular Automata were each cell is a pixel
21:30 - changed each pixel to be of set ‘size’.
// TODO - try to test actual algorithm, shapes seem wrong.
    - delete and re-write with an object of ‘cell’ and an array of ‘cells’. 

Next Day:
12:30 - Start
I decided not to refactor and re-write into OOP model. instead I wanted to simply de-bug.

13:47 - fully working according to algorithm!!
bugs in order:
- as next[] wasn’t initiated for all locations the second round was already receiving NaN errors as it was trying to reach undefined values in next. >> added a board.slice to fully copy the array.
- board[x][y] was being updated automatically when I was assigning values to next[x][y] - they were bound together although i used slice. >> the slice was affecting only the outer level (i.e. board[i] !== next[i], but the inner arrays were bound together), I added slicing per inner array at the end of the nextGen() to fully separate the two arrays.plan

13:55 - finished commenting and organizing code.
