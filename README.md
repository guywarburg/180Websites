# 180Websites

Following <a href="http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com/archive" target="_blank">Jennifer Dewalt's</a> idea, I decided to build 180 websites in 180 days.
The code isn't perfect.
The sites aren't all useful or pretty, but hey, it's good practice.

edit: 
Starting at day 44 I added to each day a 'plan.txt' file. This is a description of the site and my plan of how to accomplish it.
