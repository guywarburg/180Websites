Start plan - 11:45

Todayâ€™s mission - build a simple snake game in a HTML canvas.
phase one - exact copy - hit a wall and lose, each level has as many spots as the level and you level up only when you â€˜eatâ€™ all spots.

html:
canvas in center of screen and display of level underneath.
modal view for â€˜game-overâ€™.
Iâ€™ll skip the instructions screen.

css:
quite basic.

JS:
Thought to implement the snake as a linked-list - that way when I want to move it I simply remove one node and add another at the other end.

so Weâ€™ll have snakeNodes object:
variables: next(node), prev (node), x (start location), y (start location), move direction (up, down, left or right).
methods: createNode, removeNode, move (create a new node, and remove the last node), increment (create new node without removing a node)

We will also have a food object:
variables: x,y - position and visible boolean.

all food will be stored in an array which will be cleared on levelUp.

other variables:
canvas height and width.
size (will apply to both for and snakeNodes)

I guess thatâ€™s it ðŸ˜ƒ

start code: 12:25 - next test point at 13:00

13:00 - layout in place. started working on js layout (variables and objects). next check-in - 13:45.

13:45 - Finished basic object - debugging before I get into game functionality (which I realized I didnâ€™t define.
Also - separated the Snake object from the SnakeNode. Snake has functionality and Node has basic variables.
Want to test all function and start implementing game play by 14:30.

Due to unforced events (my parents showed up at 14:30 - resumed work at around 16:00) I just Finished!! 17:20

Pretty messy code - need to review and make more pretty.
Also found a few minor bug - Food might show up on snake.

Total time - 5.5 hours.

TODO -
1. fix bug
2. refactor
3. move to phase 2.
