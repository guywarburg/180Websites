Day 51 - Memory Game

Start plan - 14:00
Today’s website is a simple memory game.
build a grid of 30 cards. on click the card flips to display it’s content.
on match score + 1 and cards remain revealed.

game is over when all cards are revealed.

Option - number on cards, mahjong ‘cards’ to confuse.

HTML:
    h1 title at top left.
    game container
        scoreboard container
            h2 title
            p - attempts span- num
            p - matches span- num
        cards container
            div.card + id * 30

CSS:
locate h1.
center game container.
float cards (within the card container) to fill a board.

JS:
Card object:
    id, value

init() - creates necessary cards and places on board.
onClick - reveal(card-id), match(card1, card2)
match(card1, card2) - 
    if both cards have the same value:
        match +1
    else
        unravel cards
    attempt + 1
    if ( match === cards /2)
        gameOver

plan:
1. build layout.
2. build init and test - find a array shuffle method.
3. add reveal - decide if each element is two divs or if reveal changes the bg-color and adds the value.
4. add match
5. add game over
6. improve design
    

Start - 14:25

1. Layout - in place - 14:40 - // TODO - add styling - currently elements in place.
2. Build init - Init ready - 15:00 - Managed to build with only JS Vanilla.
3. add reveal - reveal works - 15:20 - need to add style - didn’t randomize array order.
4. PAUSE - 15:25 - 16:40
5. Randomize array order - 16:45 - done. Used a simple Stack Overflow example.
6. Add match() - 17:25 - finished program. Had to add a div cover to stop additional clicks.
7. game over - 17:40 - displays modal, doesn’t reset game or display stats.
8. Full game functionality - 18:20 // TODO - refactor and add some style.
