Basic website where on a certain trigger confetti fall and gather at the bottom of the screen.

html:
create a small button and a large canvas

css:
style button, add some cool transition and animation

js:
auto create canvas attributes.
on click create a bunch of confetti and make it fall to the bottom of the screen.
play with z-index and speed to create a pretty animation.

1. html + css (basic layout)
2. css - transition and animation (alternating lightbulbs - broadway style), can quickly look for gif.
3. js: confetti object:
    1. var - location (x, y, z), size, color.
    2. methods - move, draw
4. js: run with

Checking Jennifer’s script for improvements
Her only difference is that she cuts out any confetti that reached the bottom into a separate array to improve performance.
