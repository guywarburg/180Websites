Start coding - 14:15

Finished to implement my idea but there were too many intervals and the program just ran too slow.
Then I tried to alternate a bit but it was simply too slow so I googled a bit.

15:25 - Finished a while ago by copying an example from Stack-Overflow:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22003491/animating-canvas-to-look-like-tv-noise

Spent most of the last hour reading about ImageData object and the 8-bit Clamped Array and the Uint32Array.
Not sure I got it but I need to try and manipulate the Image data a bit to get it.
Another new topic was the Animate Frame which I need to look into.
