Day 52 - Etch-A-Sketch

Start Plan - 13:55
build a simple etch a sketch - see example here

Let’s split into to phases
phase 1 - functionality
phase 2 - styling

HTML:
phase 1:
    h1 title
    div container
        canvas
        reset button

phase 2 - add the background image to canvas and switch button with shake-to-reset

CSS:
phase 1:
    basic layout and location
phase 2:
    add image

JS:
phase 1:
global variables:
    canvas, ctx, xLoc, yLoc
functions:
    eventlistener - keydown drawLine(direction)
    on-button-click - erase canvas.
    draw - continue line from xLoc and yLoc in given direction.

phase 1.5:
    try to make draw a closure with bloc and yLoc hidden.

phase 2:
    clearCanvas : change from onClick to onShake.

Plan:
1. html phase 1
2. css phase 1
3. js event listener on keydown
4. bind function to canvas
5. add button
6. html and css phase 2
7. js phase 2
8. optional - js phase 1.5

START - 14:05
1. html - done - 14:10
2. css - done - 14:13
3. js - arrows bind works - 14:18
4. draw function works - 14:25 - forgot to add button for erase. Cannot press two button at once.
5. tested diagonal - for now I'll pass -  14:30
6. 14:37 - Instead of adding a button I implemented the clearRect on the canvas itself - “canvas.onClick”...

took a break and forgot to note when i started again.
I think it took about half an hour to add the image,  learn and implement the drag-and-drop for the etch.

Not working perfect as it drags the parent element without the child (the div without the canvas) so it doesn’t look great.

I prefer to try using closures than to fix this.

15:35 - starting closures.
15:55 - failed :/ need to ask someone for an example.



// TODO - improve drag feature.
            - block at edges, drawing expands outside the canvas.
