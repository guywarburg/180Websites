Target:

Create a color test -
One square displays a random color. The other changes color by moving the mouse over it and scrolling - 
up and down affect the brightness, right and left affect the hue and scrolling the saturation.

Issues:
I’m not sure how to control the scrolling
Don’t know enough about color definition - both for controlling the hue, brightness and saturation and for calculating the mistake rate.

Pseudo Code:
 
html -
    two divs in a container, button at the bottom left corner for explanation and a header at the top left corner.

css -
    nothing special, can try the .div + .div selector to create a margin between the two divs.

js -
    show modal on button click.
    on mousemove -
        translate e.pageX to hue
        translate e.pageY to saturation
    on scroll (learn how this works)
        translate location to color
    on click
        calculate difference between colors and display.

Progress:
didn’t clock beginning.
12:20 - layout complete.
14:00 - finished main JS functionality, need to add modal view and feedback text.
16:00 - completely finished!! took way too long to setup and organize modal (especially the victory text).

Question:
    first design i used getSat, getLum then I made them into one function - not sure what’s better.

Lessons:
    childNode includes textNodes which makes it harder to manipulate, use children but check browser compatibility.
    Finally understood what hue, saturation and luminosity is.
    I think I improved with my commenting and function building, though everything is global at the moment.
