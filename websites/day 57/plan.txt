Day 57 - Bug Blaster

canon game - a canon is placed in bottom left corner. user can change angle and power of bullet. bugs are placed on the screen and bullet kills them. each round there are a few bugs on the screen and to level up you must kill them all.

Try to implement with a JS object of gameState which will include a two dimensional array representing the board.

HTML + CSS:
just a canvas

JS:
objects:
- canon:
    const location
    var angle
    var speed
    function move (up/down)
    function changePower(speed up/down)
    function get(object of speed and angle)

-bullet:
    var location x
    var location y
    var direction x
    var direction y
    var speed

not completely sure about plan.
Want to try and implement the canon itself and then think again about the gameState.

start: 15:30
1. 15:45 - layout ready.

Took some time off :/

Plan - 
* Layout (set)
* Create Canon object (ready)
* Add event listeners
* create bullet object
* test ‘fire’ function with canon
* add bug object
* try and add State object
* test full game (one fixed round)
* add rounds json

Start - 15:35

1. 15:55 - canon fully ready, might need to add a `get` function > next > bullet object
2. 17:00 - bullet and canon ready! > next > adding bugs
3. 17:30 - bug class ready > add ‘kill’ method

Game functional - didn’t include reset...


TODO:
* ignore bullet flying over top of screen
* Fix to three layer program such as in this example - http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/11679/am-i-on-the-right-track-with-pong
* add level up and game over overlays
