Mission:
Analog Clock
build a analog clock using a canvas element.


Regarding html and css we simply have a centered canvas element - this part is a no brainer.

JS:

- on load we will create a time object and create 3 global variables sec, min, hour.

- Basic layout: we have three circles, I think to try and build each with a separate object representing each. Each will have the required variables to draw the circle and two methods: .draw() and .update(). draw displays the basic layout and update moves the current time.

- update time: set an interval that updates all 3 circles every second.

Issues:
how to create a dotted circle.
how to calculate the relative place of the current time in radians.
*maybe separate the current time from the layout.

Progress:
1 hour - finished basic layout. The dots certainly were a bit tricky. Didn’t find any ready-made 
not sure how long it took - completed the website. I need to refactor a few of the functions, add a few constants as it became hell and add dynamic color change.

Lessons:
Radians and trigonometry (at least the basics) aren’t as scary as I remembered.
