Day 53 - Space Invader

plan - 18:30

Build a simple space invaders game.

Html:
- full screen canvas

css - none.

JS:
1. auto apply full-screen size canvas.
2. use animation frame for auto looping.
3. Objects:
    1. invader
        1. Variables: color (rand), xLoc (rand), yLoc(0), dy(rand), visible(boolean - true)
        2. Methods: move(bloc += dy), isVisible (return visible), draw(), getLocation
    2. Player
        1. Variables: xLoc (rand), yLoc(0)
        2. Methods: moveRight, moveLeft, draw
    3. Bullet
        1. Variables: xLoc (rand), yLoc(0), dy(const), visible(boolean)
        2. Methods: move, draw, getLocation, is visible
4. Init:
    1. create invaders
    2. draw invaders
    3. draw player
    4. add event listeners - right/left = player.move, space-bar = new Bullet
    5. start loop
5. loop:
    1. for invader in invaders - move
    2. for bullet in bullets - move
    3. compare location of bullets and invaders - if same set visible of both to false, add new invader
    4. for invader in invaders - if visible => draw
    5. for bullet in bullets - if visible => draw
    6. player.draw
  
Goals:
- try to use closures
- think of way to optimize loop functionality.

BUG - player can move out of screen.

‘killing’ functionality works!!! - removes both bullet and invader, and created a new invader.
> next > add score and game-over
> next > contain game to screen
Pause - 20:50

Continued (didn’t take time)
Game contained n screen.
Game keeps score.
